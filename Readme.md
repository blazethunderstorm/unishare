## Seamless Cross-Platform File Sharing

Unishare is a powerful Tauri application built with Rust that enables seamless offline file sharing between macOS and Windows devices. It bridges the gap between Apple's AirDrop and Windows' Nearby Share with a universal solution that works across platforms, without requiring devices to be on the same Wi-Fi network.

## ✨ Features

- **🖥️ Cross-Platform**: Share files between macOS and Windows seamlessly
- **🔌 Works Offline**: Transfer files without an internet connection
- **🌐 Multiple Connection Methods**: Automatically selects the optimal connection method
- **🔒 Security-Focused**: Optional Midnight blockchain integration for enhanced security and data integrity
- **🎯 User-Friendly**: Simple drag-and-drop interface
- **⚡ Fast Transfers**: Optimized for speed with direct device-to-device connections

## 🔄 How It Works

Unishare intelligently selects the best available connection method in this priority order:

1. **Wi-Fi Direct** - For nearby devices, even without internet (Best Case)
2. **WebRTC** - When both devices have internet access (Alternative 1)
3. **Bluetooth** - For close-range sharing when Wi-Fi isn't available (Alternative 2)
4. **Mobile Data** - As a fallback option when other methods fail (Last Resort)

## 🚀 Installation

### macOS
```
brew install unishare
```

### Windows
```
winget install unishare
```

Or download the installer directly from our [releases page](https://github.com/unishare/releases).

## 📝 Usage

1. Launch Unishare on both devices
2. Select files you want to share
3. Choose the recipient device from the discovered devices list
4. Confirm the transfer on the receiving device
5. Files are transferred directly between devices

## 🔐 Advanced Security with Midnight Blockchain

Unishare offers optional integration with the Midnight blockchain for enhanced security:

- **Data Integrity & Logging**: Tamper-proof records of file transfers with blockchain verification
- **Decentralized Authentication**: Secure device verification before transfers
- **Secure Key Management**: Additional layer of encryption security

To enable Midnight integration:

1. Go to Settings > Security
2. Enable "Blockchain Security"
3. Follow the setup instructions

## 💻 Development

Unishare is built with:
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) - For the application framework
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - For performance-critical backend operations
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For the frontend interface

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/unishare/unishare.git
cd unishare

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build
```

## 🔍 Technical Architecture

Unishare follows a sophisticated connection flow as visualized in the diagram below:

1. **Transfer Request**: User initiates file transfer
2. **Device Support Check**: System checks available connection methods
3. **Connection Attempt**: Tries each method in priority order until successful
4. **File Security**: Computes file hash and integrates with Midnight blockchain
5. **Transfer Verification**: Ensures file integrity before completing the transfer

The blockchain integration provides three key security features:
- File hash storage for integrity verification
- Secure encryption key management
- Device and user authentication
